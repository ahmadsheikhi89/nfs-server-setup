## ⚙️ Prerequisites
- Rocky Linux 9.5
- Root or sudo privileges
- A second disk (e.g. `/dev/sdb`) for NFS data

## 🚀 How to Use
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmadsheikhi89/nfs-server-setup.git
cd nfs-server-setup
chmod +x nfs-setup.sh
sudo ./nfs-setup.sh
```
> You'll be prompted at each step. It's designed to be educational and interactive.

> 🛠️ **Note:** Please customize the script to match your organization's infrastructure and security policies before using it in production environments.

## 📥 Example Output
```bash
ℹ️  [INFO] Setting hostname to nfs-server01.corp.example.com
ℹ️  [INFO] Installing NFS server packages
ℹ️  [INFO] Configuring NFS exports
ℹ️  [INFO] Creating LVM volume on /dev/sdb
✔️  You can now mount nfs-server01:/nfsdata from allowed clients.
```

## 📦 Client Configuration (Mounting NFS)
To mount the exported NFS share on a client (e.g. Rocky Linux, RHEL, or CentOS):

### 📌 Option A: Manual Configuration

**Step 1: Install required packages**
```bash
sudo dnf install -y nfs-utils
```

**Step 2: Create the mount directory**
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfsdata
```

**Step 3: Mount the share**
```bash
sudo mount -o rw,sync,noatime nfs-server01.corp.example.com:/nfsdata /mnt/nfsdata
```

**Make it persistent:**
```bash
echo "nfs-server01.corp.example.com:/nfsdata  /mnt/nfsdata  nfs  rw,sync,noatime  0  0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

**SELinux adjustment (if enabled):**
```bash
sudo setsebool -P use_nfs_home_dirs 1
```

### 📌 Option B: Use Provided Script
You can automate this process using the included script:
```bash
chmod +x nfs-client-setup.sh
sudo ./nfs-client-setup.sh
```
This script will:
- Install required packages
- Create the mount point
- Mount the remote NFS share
- Add it to `/etc/fstab`
- Configure SELinux for NFS

---

## ✅ Recommended Configuration:
- Ensure DNS resolves the NFS server FQDN correctly.
- Make sure the NFS ports are open on the client.
- SELinux should allow NFS mounts (`setsebool -P use_nfs_home_dirs 1`).
- Avoid mounting with `no_root_squash` unless needed.

---

## 🧠 Educational Value
This script is meant for:
- Linux sysadmins looking to understand NFS setup deeply
- Educational labs
- Organizations wanting to build infrastructure step-by-step

---

## 🔒 Security Notes
- The script disables root login via SSH.
- SELinux is enforced.
- All modifications are logged and confirmed.
- Example user `utapp` is created with custom UID/GID.
- Clients must be explicitly allowed in `/etc/exports`.
